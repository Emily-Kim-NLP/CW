# Creative Writing (CW) Dataset and Code Repository
This repository supports the research for the paper "Evaluating Creativity: Can LLMs Be Good Evaluators in Creative Writings?" It provides essential resources for both the generation and evaluation of creative writing (CW) using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs).

Contents:

-Dataset: A curated collection of creative writing samples for research and evaluation including 200 human-written stories and 200 GPT4-generated stories.

-Generation Code: Utilizes the GPT-4 model to generate creative writing samples based on a range of input prompts.

-Evaluation Code: Implements GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4O) and GPT-3.5 Turbo models to evaluate the creativity of generated texts across several predefined criteria.



This repository is integral to ongoing research in automated creative writing processes and LLM-based evaluation, providing tools for both the production and assessment of creative text through cutting-edge machine learning models.
